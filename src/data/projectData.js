        description: `Data imputation is a technique used to fill in missing or incomplete data points 
        within a dataset.  Imputation methods estimate and replace missing values with estimated or 
        predicted values based on the available data.The goal of data imputation is to enhance the quality 
        and integrity of the dataset, allowing for more accurate analysis and interpretation. Collaborated within a team of three to implement three missing data imputation methods 
        using Pythonâ€”Class Center-Based Missing Value Imputation (CCMVI), Fuzzy C Means, and tree data
        imputation. Conducted performance comparisons to assess methods efficiency and accuracy.

The goal is to create a database that can effectively manage the accounting information of a job shop, a type of manufacturing process that involves customizing products for specific clients.
        The project involves building the database on an Azure SQL Server, according to the given requirements for the database system. This includes designing an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram, listing out the relational database schema, providing a data element dictionary, and discussing the choices of storage structures for all relational tables. SQL statements are then constructed to create tables and implement them on the Azure SQL Database.
